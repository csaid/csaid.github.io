        Canadian funding models for all
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>The US and Canada have very different systems for funding science. To compare them, I found some of the publicly available data on <a href="http://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm">NIH R01s</a> (USA) and <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/_doc/Funding-Financement/DGStat2012-SDStat2012_eng.pdf">NSERC Individual Discovery Grants</a> (Canada), and plotted them below. Before describing the results, I should say that comparing NIH to NSERC is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, since NSERC is probably closer to the NSF than to the NIH. Nevertheless, the cross-country trends hold up across agencies, and in any case my goal is not to compare countries (as much as I would like to) but to compare funding models.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig2.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>There are two things to notice about the plots. First, the funding rates are clearly higher at NSERC than at NIH. The catch, of course, is that higher rates mean smaller awards. NSERC typically provides $35,000/year, far less than the big awards from NIH. Canadian scientists <a href="http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/should-granting-agencies-fund-projects-or-people/">love</a> their system, valuing the stability it provides more than the possibility of large awards. Quality of life issues aside, a separate question is: Does the NSERC system produce better science? Or do the high success rates waste too much money on low-quality projects? My feeling is that the NSERC system is much better. High-quality NIH proposals are routinely rejected for arbitrary reasons, and the sink-or-swim culture is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/17/science/rise-in-scientific-journal-retractions-prompts-calls-for-reform.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2">directly contributing</a> to bad research practices. We should move toward a higher rate / smaller award system. And for those who see value in large awards, we can still adjust the size of the award based on the quality of the proposal.</p>

<p>The second thing to notice about the plots is the trends over time. At NIH, more so than at NSERC, the decline in success rates is driven by an increase in the number of applicants, not by a decrease in the number of awards. I don’t think the solution is just “more funding”, especially in the current fiscal climate. We have a denominator problem, not a numerator problem. We should fix the system that rewards programs for producing more PhDs than the system can accommodate. I’ll leave it to actual experts to decide how to do this. But as with most public policy questions, a good place to start is to just copy whatever the Canadians are doing.</p>

        In defense of correlation/causation blowhards
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2013</span>

    <p>Let’s get one thing out of the way first: There is not a single scientist or science journalist who doesn’t know that correlation does not equal causation. Most have probably known it since high school.</p>

<p>That’s why there has been a bit of a backlash against internet commenters who keep pointing it out. The phrase is “common and irritating”, writes Slate’s Daniel Engber in his article <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/10/correlation_does_not_imply_causation_how_the_internet_fell_in_love_with_a_stats_class_clich_.single.html">The Internet Blowhard’s Favorite Phrase</a>. To Engber, correlation≠causation is a “freshman platitude” that professional scientists and journalists don’t need to be reminded of. Scientists are merely <em>suggesting</em> a causal relationship. They are not claiming it is proven.</p>

<p>I can see why writers and researchers find it frustrating to be scolded about something they already know. But correlation≠causation is one of those things that has a way of sliding onto the back burner of one’s mental awareness, even among scientists. On one day a research group is acknowledging the limits to their correlational study, but the next day they are advancing policy arguments that depend on a causal relationship. Or more commonly, they are preparing to run yet another correlational study.</p>

<p>Nowhere does this seem more of an issue than in nutrition science and in education research. In nutrition science, it is much easier to conduct a simple survey on health and eating habits than to organize a large-scale longitudinal randomized control study. Is it any wonder then, that after 50 years of nutrition science <a href="http://grist.org/scary-food/2011-03-04-low-fat-diet-fad/">we still don’t know</a> whether saturated fat is good for you or bad for you? And in education research, it is much easier to run a correlational study on class size and achievement than it is to run a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0297.00586/abstract">randomized control study</a>. Is it any wonder then, that the public policy debate about class size is so muddled?</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong – There is some fantastic causal research coming out of the nutrition and education fields. And there is nothing wrong with running a correlational study either. Correlational studies are a great way for researchers to identify variables that are promising enough to investigate with causal methods.</p>

<p>But could it be that we have struck the wrong balance between correlational studies and causal studies? Could we be allocating too many resources towards easy but inconclusive studies, and not enough towards costly but more definitive research? I think the answer might be yes, and that internet comment blowhards are an important voice for this point of view.</p>

        New paper on autism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>If there is one thing I have learned recently, it is that autism is a really, really complicated disorder. Autism is best known for causing repetitive behaviors and problems with social communication, but it is also known to cause issues in sensory perception. Many hypotheses for the underlying neurophysiological basis have been proposed. Among these is the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance hypothesis, which states that levels of cortical excitation and inhibition are disrupted in autism. An imbalance like this could be caused by unusual levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, or by an unusual distribution of synaptic connections. Together with my collaborators (David Heeger, Marlene Behrmann, Nancy Minshew, and Ryan Egan), we tested this theory and report the results in a new <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2012.11.002">paper</a> published in <em>Vision Research</em>.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/network1.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>We chose to test the theory in the visual system because vision is one of the better understood systems in neuroscience and because the E/I imbalance theory has been proposed to explain hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli in autism. Specifically, we conducted two experiments on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_rivalry">binocular rivalry</a>, a well-studied phenomenon that depends critically on excitation and inhibition levels in cortex. Using a very simple computational model (a schematic is shown above), we made predictions about how imbalances in excitation and inhibition would affect perception during rivalry. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant differences between autistic individuals and controls, and no evidence for a relationship between these measurements and the severity of autism. Of course, these results do not conclusively rule out an E/I imbalance in the visual system of those with autism. There are many alternative explanations that we describe in the Discussion section. But these results do seem to suggest that an E/I imbalance, if it exists, is likely to be small in magnitude.</p>

        Why are contrast response functions linear in fMRI and nonmonotonic in EEG?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2012</span>

    <p>Contrast response functions (CRFs) describe how a neuron’s firing rate depends on the contrast, or intensity, of a visual stimulus. CRFs are really important for testing theories about how the visual system works, and I’ve spent a lot of time over the past few years trying to indirectly measure them in humans, using EEG and fMRI. The problem, however, is that EEG and fMRI give me very different CRFs.</p>

<p>Typically, individual neurons show sigmoidal CRFs. They don’t fire at all for very low contrasts, but they rapidly increase their firing rate at a middle range of contrast. The midpoint of this range is sometimes called the ‘semisaturation constant’. After that, the firing rate tends to level off, or ‘saturate’.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_intro_neuron2.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>With fMRI, however, I tend to find that the CRFs are mostly linear, not sigmoidal.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_intro_fmri1.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>And with EEG, I often find that the CRFs are actually nonmonotonic!</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_intro_eeg1.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>This is weird, and I’m not the first person to notice it. Linear CRFs in fMRI are quite common (e.g. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9535979">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22153378">here</a>), as are nonmonotic CRFs in EEG (e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v321/n6067/abs/321235a0.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/12/4530.short">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1192067/">here</a>,  and <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/8/2783.short">here</a> ). While not all papers show these effects, they certainly seem like real trends. How it is possible that an underlying sigmoidal function in neurons could give rise to such completely different functions measured by fMRI and EEG?</p>

<p>To explain the linear fMRI responses, one idea is that fMRI takes an average over many different neurons, each with a different semisaturation constant. Some neurons saturate early, some saturate late, and when you average them all together you just get a line.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_fmri1.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>That seems to make sense. But what about the nonmonotonic CRFs in EEG? One idea is that EEG CRFs might reflect the true contrast response functions of individual neurons, many of which are themselves <a href="http://ww.w.journalofvision.org/content/7/6/13.short">nonmonotonic</a>. While I don’t doubt that this could be a contributing factor, I have trouble believing that this explains all, or even most, of the nonmonotonicity in EEG. Only a small minority of visual cells exhibit this property, and I have seen some _massive _nonmonotonicity in some of my most reliable EEG subjects.</p>

<p>A different hypothesis is that nonmonotonicity is caused by the cancellation of dipoles across cortical sulci or gyri. EEG dipoles are oriented normal to the cortical surface and, since the cortex has so many folds, many of the electrical signals simply <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19639553">cancel</a> each other out.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_dipole1.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. Different cortical areas (e.g. V1 and V2) have different average semisaturation constants. (They tend to get lower the higher you move up in the visual hierarchy). Imagine that two cortical areas with different semisaturation constants live on opposite sides of a sulcus. At medium contrasts, one area will be active and the other will be mostly silent. But at higher contrasts, <em>both</em> areas will have kicked in, and so the overall signal (due to cancellation) will be actually _lower _that at medium contrast. This isn’t my idea, but it makes a lot of sense and I think it deserves more attention.</p>

<figure class="image"><img src="/assets/fig_eeg2.png" alt="" /></figure>

<p>But wait, the fMRI explanation makes sense, and the EEG explanation makes sense, but how can they both be true? After all, the EEG cancellation story only works if each area’s average CRF is nonlinear: If the average responses were linear (as demonstrated by the fMRI explanation), cancellation of opposite CRFs would just result in more straight lines, right?</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. Using simulations I have found it quite easy to capture both effects. In the fMRI simulation, a perfectly linear CRF emerges only if I assume that the underlying neural semisaturation constants are uniformly distributed, which is quite an unlikely assumption. With any other reasonable distribution (e.g. normal distribution) I get fMRI CRFs that are mostly linear but with a touch of sigmoid. And critically, that touch of sigmoid will drive the dipole cancellation in a way that results in nonmonotonic EEG CRFs.</p>

<p>Below is some Matlab code showing how this works, just a proof of concept. It makes some very, very simplifying assumptions, and I’m sure that the truth is far more complicated.</p>
