title: Part 2&#58; A bipartisan list of people who are good for America
description: Writers and media personalities who make their case in good faith
---

In [Part 1](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2017/07/09/part-1-a-bipartisan-list-of-people-who-are-bad-for-america/), I posted a bipartisan list of people who are bad for America. Those people present news stories that cherry pick the worst actions from the other side so that they can get higher TV ratings and more social media points. 

In Part 2, I want to post a list of people who don’t do that. This isn’t a list of centrists. If anything, it is a more politically diverse list than the list in Part 1. This is a list of people who make good-faith attempts to persuade others about their point of view. 

* **Megan McArdle** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/AQjVOcPejrY/megan-mcardle)) - Moderately libertarian ideas presented to a diverse audience
* **Noah Smith** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/AR3OYuAmvcU/noah-smith)) - Center-left economics
* **Ross Douthat** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT), [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ross-douthat)) - Social conservatism presented to a left-of-center audience
* **Noam Chomsky** ([Website](https://chomsky.info/articles/))
* **Conor Friedersdorf** ([The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/conor-friedersdorf))
* **Ben Sasse** - Has the third-most conservative voting record in the Senate but never caricatures the other side and is very concerned about filter bubbles. 
* **Julia Galef** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliagalef)) - Has some [great advice](https://twitter.com/juliagalef/status/850126407963262976) for understanding the other side 
* **Nicky Case** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ncasenmare))
* **Fareed Zakaria** ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/fareed-zakaria/)) - Center-left foreign policy
* **Eli Lake** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/EliLake), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/ASD1bG3hdiI/eli-lake)) - Hawkish foreign policy
* **Kevin Drum** ([Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/)) Center-left blogger who writes in good faith
* **John Carl Baker** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/johncarlbaker)) - One of the few modern socialists I have found who avoids in-group snark.
* **Michael Dougherty** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelbd), [The Week](http://theweek.com/authors/michael-brendan-dougherty))
* **Reihan Salam** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/reihan), [NRO](http://www.nationalreview.com/author/reihan-salam))
* **Avik Roy** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Avik), [NRO](http://www.nationalreview.com/author/avik-roy)) - Conservative health care
* **Ezra Klein** ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein), [early days at the American Prospect](http://prospect.org/authors/ezra-klein)) - While at the American Prospect, Ezra did an amazing job trying to persuade people about the benefits of Obamacare. Vox, the explainer site that he started, sometimes slips into red meat clickbait. But to its credit, Vox has managed to reach a wide audience with mostly explainer content.

Reading the people on this list with an open mind will broaden your worldview. This list is non-exhaustive.
