Some videos on the internet are so good that I've watched them twice. Below is a list of 10 of my favorite interviews and dialogues. Obviously this isn't an endorsement of all the positions taken. I just think they are very well done and fun to watch. The last four are best watched on 1.4x speed.



	
  1. [1971](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x16z2ff_parkinson-interviews-muhammad-ali-1971-full_news) Michael Parkinson interviews Muhammad Ali.
