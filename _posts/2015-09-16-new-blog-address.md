Welcome to the new location for The File Drawer! This blog is now hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). My old blog at [filedrawer.wordpress.com](http://filedrawer.wordpress.com) will be shutting down soon.

I actually really liked WordPress, but I wanted to have a little bit more control over what I can put in my posts. In particular, I wanted to be able to insert my own JavaScript animations, for example in [this post](http://chris-said.io/2015/09/17/presidential-debates/) on the recent presidential debates.

It was pretty fun to migrate everything over from WordPress – which is not to say there weren't some hiccups along the way – but I was able to do so by following some nice instructions in [this post by Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/).

For those of you using RSS, the feed for [www.chris-said.io](http://chris-said.io/) should be searchable in your RSS readers, but please let me know if it's not.
