        Jason Mitchell's essay
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>As of yesterday I thought the debate about replication in psychology was converging on consensus in at least one respect. While there was still some disagreement about tone, <a href="http://www.spspblog.org/simone-schnall-on-her-experience-with-a-registered-replication-project/">basically</a> <a href="http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/03/12/the-truth-is-not-optional-five-bad-reasons-and-one-mediocre-one-for-defending-the-status-quo/">everyone</a> agreed that there was value in failed replications. But then this morning, Jason Mitchell posted <a href="http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jmitchel/writing/failed_science.htm">this essay</a>, in which he describes his belief that failed replication attempts can contain errors and therefore “cannot contribute to a cumulative understanding of scientific phenomena”. It’s hard to know where to begin when someone comes from a worldview so different from one’s own. Since there’s clearly a communication problem here, I’ll just give two examples to illustrate how I think about science.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example 1</strong>. A rigorous lab conducts an experiment using a measurement device that requires special care. The effect size is d=0.5. Later, a different lab with no experience using the device tries to quickly replicate the experiment and computes an effect size of d=0.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Example 2</strong>. A small sample experiment in a field with a history of p-hacking shows an effect size of d=0.5. Another lab tries to replicate the study with a much larger sample and computes an effect size of d=0.0.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, I’d have subjective beliefs about the true effect size. For the first example, my posterior distribution might peak around d=0.4. For the second example, my posterior distribution might peak around d=0.1. In both cases, the replication would influence my posterior, but to varying degrees. In the first example, it would cause a small shift. In the second, it would cause a big shift. Reasonable people can disagree on the exact positions of the posteriors, but basically everyone ought to agree that our posteriors should incrementally adjust as we acquire new information, and that the size of these shifts should depend on a variety of factors, including the possibility of errors in either the original experiment or in the replication attempt. Maybe it’s because I’m stuck in a worldview, but none of this even seems very hard to understand. </p>

<p>Jason Mitchell <a href="http://wjh.harvard.edu/~jmitchel/writing/failed_science.htm">sees</a> things differently. For him, all failed replications contain “no meaningful evidentiary value” and “do not constitute scientific output”. I don’t doubt the sincerity of his beliefs, but I suspect that most scientists and nonscientists alike will find these assertions to be pretty bizarre. NHST isn’t the only thing causing the crisis in psychology, but it’s pretty clear that this is what happens when people get too immersed in it. </p>

        How I use Twitter

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2014</span>

    <p>Next week I’m going to start a new job as a data scientist at Twitter and I am thrilled. Aside from Google search, no other website has had a more positive impact on my life than Twitter. Twitter is just so much fun, and I have learned so much from it. </p>

<p>Because my experience has been so good, it saddens me to hear that some people don’t really “get” Twitter. Some people who try it feel frustrated and stop using it. Others use it occasionally but don’t really see what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p>I want to share my approach to using Twitter so that others can try. There are probably other ways to enjoy it, but this approach has worked well for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t necessarily follow my friends, and I don’t expect them to follow me. I use Twitter for a limited set of interests, and not all of my friends tweet about those interests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I generally don’t follow organizations. They tend to tweet too much and their content is often too promotional.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead, I follow opinionated people who tweet about a small set of topics that I’m interested in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make sure that my tweet stream is slow enough that I can read every tweet. I do this by limiting the number of people I follow and by making sure that I don’t follow people who tweet too much, even if they have good content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Follow opinionated strangers who tweet about topics you are interested in. Maybe you have a different approach that works well for you. But if you are still trying to figure out the incredible appeal of Twitter, you might want to give my approach a shot.</p>

    <p>National unemployment is high, but business is booming in some states. Vermont needs teachers. Nevada needs bartenders. North Dakota needs truck drivers and just about everything else.</p>

<p>Despite these opportunities, Americans <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/november_december_2013/features/stay_put_young_man047332.php?page=all">aren’t moving much</a> and unemployment remains high.  One reason for this is that moving can be expensive and disruptive, especially for those with families and roots in their communities. But another reason may just be lack of awareness about the opportunities in other states. That’s why I have made a new website: <a href="http://www.ismyjobinanotherstate.com">www.ismyjobinanotherstate.com</a>. Enter your job skills, and the website will provide an interactive map showing where you are most in demand.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ismyjobinanotherstate.com"><figure class="image"><img src="/assets/securityofficer.png" alt="" /></figure>
</a>
States are ranked by their <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42943.pdf">ratio of job postings to unemployment</a>. This is a pretty good metric, but it isn’t perfect. To understand why, imagine two states with the same posting/unemployed ratio for a particular job. If you are trained for the job, you might have better luck applying in a state where the unemployed population is either untrained or unwilling to take that type of job, even though the two states have the same ratio. There also may be differences across states in the use of Indeed.com. Still, I think my results have reasonably good face validity, and the results for many jobs are close to what you would except. If you average across jobs, you get something pretty close to an independently created measure called the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/november_december_2013/features/the_2013_opportunity_index047357.php">“Opportunity Index”</a>.</p>

<p>Job posting data was collected using the <a href="https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed">Indeed.com api</a>. Unemployment numbers came from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/laus.t03.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. For more information about how this works, see my the <a href="https://github.com/csaid/IsMyJobInAnotherState">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

        My Insight Data Science Project
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>I just finished an excellent fellowship at <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a>. During our first few weeks there, each of us designed a website to demo at Insight’s sponsor companies. My website is called <a href="http://www.dealspotter.info">DealSpotter</a>.</p>

<p>This all started earlier this summer when I went to Craigslist to find a used car. There were lots of good deals on Craigslist, but it took way too long to find them. When I searched for a particular model, I got hundreds of hits, but only a few of the hits included the mileage in the posting title. Since I needed the mileage to know whether I was getting a good deal, I had to click on each of the hundreds of listings. Pretty time consuming.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealspotter.info"><figure class="image"><img src="/assets/listings.png" alt="" border="2px" /></figure>
</a></p>

<p>A larger problem was that even if I clicked on every post, I didn’t always have a sense for what was the best deal. For example, if I had $3,000, was it better to spend it on a 2001 model with 100K miles, or a 2003 model with 140K miles?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealspotter.info"><em>DealSpotter</em></a> is a proof-of-concept website that shows how these problems could be solved. DealSpotter grabs all the Craigslist car postings in the San Francisco Bay Area and automatically shows you the best deals. It knows how much each car should be priced, based on the model, year, and mileage. Cars that are priced lower than DealSpotter expects them to be are shown at the top of the list. DealSpotter also presents the same information in a visual format called “Graph” mode, where the best deals are highlighted in blue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealspotter.info"><figure class="image"><img src="/assets/full.png" alt="" border="2px" /></figure>
</a></p>

<p>To determine how much each car should be priced, DealSpotter doesn’t use Kelley Blue Book, which tends to overprice cars, especially newer models. Instead, DealSpotter builds its own pricing model based on the actual Craigslist market. In particular, it uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forest</a> pricing model because, unlike smooth parametric models, Random Forests are able to detect sharp discontinuities in prices that may be caused by factors such as manufacturer design overhauls.</p>

<p>By selecting cars that are priced much lower than would be expected based on year and mileage, DealSpotter picks out some incredible deals, as well as the occasional clunker with an accident history. A more elaborate service might find a way to filter for accident history, but for now DealSpotter remains useful because it greatly narrows down the scope of the search for users. Once users are dealing with a handful of posts, they can easily inspect the text of the ad to determine which cars are good deals, and which have a history of accidents.</p>

<p>If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area and are looking for a used car, you should definitely check out my website <em>right now</em>. Many cars are underpriced by thousands of dollars. In the future though, I won’t be updating the listings, which will soon become outdated. Craigslist has a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57479344-93/craigslist-sues-padmapper-for-mass-harvesting-listings/">history of suing</a> other services that try to improve on how their data is presented. Craigslist’s litigiousness is understandable – they curated the data after all. But it apparently has also <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/when-craigslist-blocks-innovations-disruptions/?_r=0">stifled innovation</a>. Craigslist users spend many hours of their time clicking on blue links because the website’s search and UI tools are still stuck in the 90’s. Users are also at higher risk of scams because there is no reputation system. Normally, issues like this would put a company out of business, but a combination of lawsuits and network lock-in effects have kept Craigslist at the top of classifieds services. Hopefully, we will one day get a better Craigslist. In the meantime, if you want to find an incredible deal on a car while the postings are still fresh, you should do so <a href="http://www.dealspotter.info">now</a>.</p>
