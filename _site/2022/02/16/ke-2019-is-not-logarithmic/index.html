<p>Last week I published a <a href="https://chris-said.io/2022/02/10/viral-count-and-infectiousness/">blog post</a> on whether infectiousness was a <em>linear</em> or <em>logarithmic</em> function of viral RNA count, as measured by PCR. The answer has significant implications for when people can return to school or work after an infection.</p>

<p>At the start of infection, viral RNA count increases exponentially, reaching about a billion copies per mL, before dropping back down to zero. If the linear model is correct, infectiousness is proportional to RNA count, which means you are only meaningfully infectious for a short period near the peak viral load. If the logarithmic model is correct, you’re meaningfully infectious with any amount of virus in your body, even trace amounts.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> The linear and logarithmic models of infectiousness. The gray curve shows RNA count in a typical infection, plotted on a log axis. The other curves are probabilities of transmission for a one-hour interaction between two people in a medium sized room. Probability is a transformation of the hazard rate (“infectiousness”), which can be modeled as a linear or logarithmic function of RNA count.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>My blog post concluded that infectiousness is a mostly linear function of <em>live viral count</em>. But when it comes to <em>observed RNA count</em>, the relationship is intermediate between linear and logarithmic, perhaps a bit closer to linear.</p>

<p>After publishing my blog post, somebody sent me <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/49/e2111477118">Ke (2021)</a>, which claims that the logarithmic model is an appropriate surrogate for infectiousness. The paper is useful and important, but I want to respond to their core claim.</p>

<h3 id="the-model-isnt-logarithmic">The model isn’t logarithmic!</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the actual Ke (2021) model isn’t logarithmic. I’ve reproduced their power-law model below. If anything, it’s much closer to linear than logarithmic!</p>

<div class="wrapper">
  <p><img src="/assets/2022_ke_2019_is_not_logarithmic/linear_log_power.png" class="inner" style="position:relative border: #222 2px solid; max-width:100%;" /></p>
  <div class="caption">
    <p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The power-law model described in Ke (2021) is closer to a linear model than a logarithmic model. The \(\phi\) parameter is rescaled so that there is a similar area under the curve as the other models.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The paper also presents a saturation model. While it’s less linear than the power-law model, I think it’s fair to call it midway between linear and logarithmic.</p>

<div class="wrapper">
  <p><img src="/assets/2022_ke_2019_is_not_logarithmic/linear_log_saturation.png" class="inner" style="position:relative border: #222 2px solid; max-width:100%;" /></p>
  <div class="caption">
    <p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> The saturation model described in Ke (2021) falls between a linear model and a logarithmic model. The \(\theta\) parameter is rescaled so that there is a similar area under the curve as the other models.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I’m not sure why Ke (2021) comes to a “logarithmic” conclusion, given that both of their models are not too far from linear. I suspect it was mostly an oversight. Covid research moves fast, and perhaps they were visualizing their data in a different way than I am.</p>

<h3 id="the-symptom-data-isnt-that-convincing">The symptom data isn’t that convincing</h3>
<p>Ke (2021) uses some symptom data to provide additional evidence for nonlinearity. The argument is as follows:
Epidemiological evidence suggests that &gt;30% of transmission occurs pre-symptomatically.
Data from Wölfel (2020) suggests that symptom onset occurs early in the viral load curve.
Under the linear model, almost all transmission would occur around the peak of infection and – using the Wölfel data – only 8% would occur pre-symptomatically. Because this is lower than the &gt;30% observed epidemiologically, the linear model should be rejected.</p>

<div class="wrapper">
  <p><img src="/assets/2022_ke_2019_is_not_logarithmic/symptoms.png" class="inner" style="position:relative border: #222 2px solid; max-width:100%;" /></p>
  <div class="caption">
    <p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Illustration of the symptom logic used in Ke (2021). The linear model predicts only a small amount of transmission would occur before symptoms, which is inconsistent with epidemiological data.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I don’t want to strictly defend the linear model – I concede there is some nonlinearity. But much of Ke’s evidence from symptom data feels overstated.</p>

<p>First, Ke’s 8% estimate is based on an assumption of uniformly distributed contacts over time. In reality, people <em>reduce</em> their rate of contacts once symptoms start. The linear model should therefore predict significantly more than 8% of transmission occurs pre-symptomatically, which is more consistent with the epidemiological data. To their credit, the authors acknowledge the limitation of their assumption.</p>

<p>Second, the authors describe Wölfel (2020) as showing symptom onset occurs very early along the viral load curve. But this is inconsistent with <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.28.20202028v1">many other studies</a>, which shows that symptom onset occurs at or even after the <em>peak</em> of viral load. If those studies are true, the linear model would predict that upwards of 50% of infection occurs pre-symptomatically, consistent with the epidemiological data. In general, I suspect that the definition of “symptom onset” is murky, and that any conclusions based on cross-study comparisons will be fraught with uncertainty.</p>

<p>To summarize, the nonlinear models in Ke (2019) are important and useful; they just aren’t logarithmic! The truth is intermediate between linear and logarithmic and, if anything, may be slightly closer to linear.</p>
