<p>Welcome to the new location for The File Drawer! This blog is now hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. My old blog at <a href="http://filedrawer.wordpress.com">filedrawer.wordpress.com</a> will be shutting down soon.</p>

<p>I actually really liked WordPress, but I wanted to have a little bit more control over what I can put in my posts. In particular, I wanted to be able to insert my own JavaScript animations, for example in <a href="http://chris-said.io/2015/09/17/presidential-debates/">this post</a> on the recent presidential debates.</p>

<p>It was pretty fun to migrate everything over from WordPress – which is not to say there weren’t some hiccups along the way – but I was able to do so by following some nice instructions in <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">this post by Joshua Lande</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you using RSS, the feed for <a href="http://chris-said.io/">www.chris-said.io</a> should be searchable in your RSS readers, but please let me know if it’s not.</p>
